_Set boulders. Chalk the fuck up. Send it._

A simple web app for my DIY climbing spraywall. Fully vibecoded.

---

🧠 **Set boulder problems** by selecting the holds type and clicking on the spraywall image to mark the holds. Figure out the grade, give it a shiny name, and don't forget to save it!

🧗‍♂️ **Enter the send mode** to browse through the community boulders. Grab your stinky shoes, **chalk the fuck up and send hard**! 💪💪

🔐 **Log in with your Google account** to be able to edit/delete boulders, if you're a friend close enough to know the password though :)

Built with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Panzoom, Firebase... and Claude!
